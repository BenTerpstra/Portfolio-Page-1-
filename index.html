<p>
Hello! My name is Benjamin Daniel Terpstra, but my friends call me Ben and my students call me Mr. T. I'm a seasoned actor, reluctant educator, and aspiring web developer. I was born in Oak Ridge TN and moved to Chicago in September of 2018 to pursue a career in theatre. <br>In order to finance my first year in the city, I took a position as a non-traditional volunteer with Americorps and did a year of service, and spent the majority of that time working as a teacher's aide in a 6th grade math classroom. This gave me the resume to apply for TA positions, and I stumbled into a fledgling career as an educator. I currently work as a Special Education Teacher's Aide for 6th, 7th, and 8th grades at a school on the near Southwest side of the city. <br>Although education as a profession is incredibly important and often fulfilling, I'm more and more that teaching in America is unsustainable as a career, bordering on unhealthy. The demands of teaching coupled with the inevitable financial stress that comes with a TA's have convinced me that I need to pursue a change in careers, which is what has led me here!

    <h3>Why Web Development?</h3>
      <p>
Although education as a profession is incredibly important and often fulfilling, I'm more and more that teaching in America is unsustainable as a career, bordering on unhealthy. The demands of teaching coupled with the inevitable financial stress that comes with a TA's have convinced me that I need to pursue a change in careers, which is what has led me here!<br> I think that working in Web Development is an excellent choice for a change in career path for two reasons: First, because I believe I will have a knack for it, both from a technical and interpersonal perspective; and second, because I believe it will effectively support the positive changes I need in my life at this juncture.<br>Coming from a theatre background, I have extensive experience working with others on large projects that leverage creativity. Having worked in education, I've learned how to collaboratively address immense challenges, support colleagues when times are tough, and leverage empathy and insight to improve interactions with those I work for (students, parents, administration, etc.). Having grown up in a science town and pursued science in an academic context (I was originally a physics major), I believe I have the analytical skills to meet the demands of the technical aspects of the job. <br>On a more personal note, I've known for a long time that the biggest thing getting in the way of my theatre career are work-related stress and exhaustion compounded with financial stress. Teaching doesn't really allow space in your life for anything other than teaching, and I want to be more than just my job. I believe that web development will allow me to more effectively support myself financially while reducing stress. Plus, I  get to work collaboritively with others in a creative context! Web development could meet my needs while still feeding my passion and playing to my strengths.
