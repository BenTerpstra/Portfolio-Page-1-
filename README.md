# Portfolio-Page
I honestly spent way more time on it than I should've, but I wanted to incorporate everything I've learned so far. In addition to text elements and images, I included links to specific sections in a nav bar at the top of the page, links to other pages within the same site, links to external sites, and a 404 page. 
I hope you enjoy it!
